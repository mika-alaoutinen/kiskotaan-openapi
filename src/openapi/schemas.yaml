# The OpenAPI specification has support for inheritance, however using inheritance with code generation is
# a massive PITA. To help preserve my own sanity, I've chosen to simply copy paste the models here.

# See https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/3100 for an example of the joys that await those who
# want to get fancy with their code generation tools.
