          Filter players by name. If given a single input, filter considers both the players'
          first and last names. If given two inputs separated by a plus sign, filter treats
          first input as a first name and second input as a last name. If given more than two
          inputs separated by a plus sign, filter only considers the first two inputs and
          ignores the rest. Filters do not have to be an exact match.
